Howdy, This is Rashad Tanjim. I am an engineer with 4+ years of experience in developing & architecting enterprise-level solutions. I have completed my Bachelor in Computer Science & Engineering from North South University (NSU). My major studying area was in Machine Learning & Data Science and my minor was in Computer Networks & Software Engineering.

Learning things like developing apps, architecting backend services, and creating projects on different stacks are a habit of mine. For each & every project of my work, I'm trying to learn new tech topics & develop related stuff which is helping me to enrich my knowledge in this sector. 

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer at bKash Ltd. where I mostly contribute to the Backend Technologies of the Core Platform Engineering section. Besides, I'm researching Machine Learning-related projects and have published some impactful Academic Conference and Journal papers. Thank you.
