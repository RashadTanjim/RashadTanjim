Howdy! I'm Tanjim, a results-driven Software Engineer and Researcher with a proven track record of architecting and developing large-scale distributed systems that power mission-critical services. My expertise spans backend technologies, cloud computing, and mobile application development, strongly focusing on building resilient, high-performance solutions that drive business growth and scalability.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from North South University (NSU), specializing in Artificial Intelligence with a minor in Computer Networks and Software Engineering. Beyond software development, I am actively researching cutting-edge machine learning applications and have published impactful academic papers at renowned international conferences and journals.

Currently, I am driving backend innovation at bKash Ltd. within the Research & Engineering section, where I tackle complex engineering challenges, optimize mission-critical services, and architect scalable, efficient systems. Passionate about technical leadership, mentorship, and strategic roadmap planning, I thrive in fast-paced environments that demand innovation, problem-solving, and engineering excellence.
