Howdy, This is Rashad Tanjim. I am an engineer with 3+ years of experience in the field of developing & architecting apps and websites. I have completed my Bachelor in Computer Science & Engineering from North South University (NSU). My major studying field was Machine Learning and Data Science and my minor was in Software Engineering & Computer Networks.

Learning things like developing apps, architecting solutions, and creating projects on different stacks is a habit. For each & every project of my work, I'm trying to learn new tech topics & develop related stuff which is helping me to enrich my knowledge in this area.

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer at bKash Ltd. where I'm mostly trying to contribute to the Backend Technologies of Core Platform Engineering section. Moreover, I'm researching Machine Learning projects and have already published 3 Conference papers and 1 Journal paper. Thank you.
